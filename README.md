# ProShop - A Modern React E-commerce Frontend

Welcome to ProShop, a sleek and professional frontend demonstration for an e-commerce website built with React. This project focuses on a modern, dark-themed UI with gradient effects, a clean component structure, and foundational e-commerce features like user login and registration.

**Note:** This is a frontend-only application. User authentication is simulated using the browser's `localStorage` and React's Context API. No backend or database is connected.
